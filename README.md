# Duck Diary
The Duck Diary is part of Brinja's skill proficiency test that allows developers interested in working at Brinja to show off their skills. By forking the project and submitting pull-requests with new creative and interesting features for the application you can both get an understanding of the technologies we are working with and get to prove your talent as a developer.
